# Introduction

Jael is a *domain specific language* for writing reliable, low-level embedded software. By focusing on a specific domain, restrictions can be placed on the software to acheive goals that would be difficult or impossible to acheive in a general purpose programming language. Furthermore, the design of Jael attempts to explore how various features can be incorporated to acheive embedded specific goals.

# Intended Audience

The purpose of this document is to introduce Jael to existing embedded programmers. The design and features of Jael will be compared to what is typical of low-level embedded systems, namely imperitive languages such as *C*. As such, a familiarity with such languages is assumed.
