= Building Jael

== Building on Linux

=== For Nix users
Nix users can build the compiler with the following command:
 nix-build -A haskell.packages.ghc802.jael ./nix

==== Notes
Jael overrides the haskell package set for its supported compiler in `nix/overlay.nix`. The file `nix/default.nix` imports a pinned version of nixpkgs that is used for building the compiler and specifies that `nix/overlay.nix` should be applied.

=== For Stack users
 stack setup && stack build

== Building on Windows
Support for Windows is not currently a priority. However, Windows support should not be difficult as all dependencies _should_ be able to build on Windows (the most notably difficult being the llvm).
